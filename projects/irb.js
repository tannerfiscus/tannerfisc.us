The system was written for the Robert Morris University Institutional Review Board (IRB) in order to replace an outdated, paper \"system\". This project began as a sketch of processes and flows to determine exactly how the application would work, which has formulated into the website that is now used publicly.<br><br>\r\nThe system has been uniquely configured for the three different user groups: applicants, advisors, and reviewers. The applicants are the individuals that are applying for collegiate research that needs to be reviewed by the IRB. The applicants have the ability to sign up for an account, complete the entire form with information regarding their intended research, and submit the information for review. Advisors are specified by the applicant when the form is initially submitted. Advisors must approve of the application in order for it to be submitted as a valid proposal to the IRB. Additionally, an internal area has been created for the reviewers so that they can examine each proposal and provide feedback, which will eventually lead to a final approval or denial by the committee."
