This is why the university's marketing department has worked to develop an all-new, responsive template to be used on new microsites moving forward.<br\/><br\/>\r\nPlanning for future sites is great; however, they needed to find a way to make existing content responsive, too. This was a challenge that I was up for - figuring out a solution to retrofit existing content.<br\/><br\/>I started by stripping out the existing stylesheet, which left me with a page full of HTML elements. Using SASS, I developed a new stylesheet that embraced the same design as the new template. The stylesheet got me most of the way there; however, I had to rely on some jQuery magic to help me create the mobile menu and image sliders.<br\/><br\/>I'm excited to collaborate with our marketing department to move forward on the face of rmu.edu."
