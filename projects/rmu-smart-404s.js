But, what if the error page could be smart enough to try and predict where you were trying to go?<br\/><br\/>\r\nThat's exactly what I did. Based off of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.smashingmagazine.com\/2014\/08\/12\/a-better-404-page\/\" target=\"_blank\">\"A Better 404 Page\" by Donovan Hutchinson<\/a>, the RMU 404 page tries to think for you by utilizing the Google Custom Search API. The page is designed to look at the URL that you tried to access, then talks to Google in order to try and find the rmu.edu search result that matches closest to what you typed in. This saves both time and effort for the user when they simply type something wrong.<br\/><br\/>Of course, it isn't perfect - it doesn't <em>always<\/em> know what you're looking for. That's why below the error message I have included the RMU search box."
