      Created as a demo project for an undergraduate course, the tannerfisc.us admin was developed as a way of managing existing projects on my website.
  - title: About This Project
    description: As a class project, this miniature content management system was
      just an idea that I challenged myself to make into a reality. The system
      allows me to manage, track, edit, and add new projects to my portfolio.
      The content you're currently viewing is running on this platform.
  - title: Additional Notes
    description: This mini CMS is fully adaptable to my own needs and written to
      satisfy the design of my new website. When new features are needed, I
      update the logic and methodologies behind the coding.
